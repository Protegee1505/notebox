# Notebox

Local-first personal notes app. One Rust codebase for web, Windows, Linux and Android;
Loro CRDT per note; SQLite locally; a Cloudflare Worker and D1 for sync.

The full specification and phase plan is [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Agent rules are in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Status

Bootstrap only. No product features are implemented yet. See
[docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) and [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for progress and
decision records.

## Layout

```text
crates/
  notes-proto/    wire types, ids, version envelope (wasm-safe)
  notes-core/     Loro documents, note model, history, search, Markdown
  notes-store/    NoteStore trait; SQLite and browser backends
  notes-sync/     sync engine, login, Argon2 key derivation, HTTP client
  notes-server/   Worker handlers behind a Storage trait; D1 implementation
  notes-app/      Dioxus UI for web, desktop and Android
migrations/       D1 migrations, one folder per database
docs/             status and architecture decision records
```

## Local commands

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --workspace
cargo deny check
dx serve --web
```

The UI has no default renderer. Select one explicitly:

```bash
cargo run -p notes-app --features desktop
cargo check -p notes-app --no-default-features --features web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Free-tier rule

The app must stay inside Cloudflare's free plan. Do not enable R2 and do not add a
service that needs a payment method. Sign-up steps and account actions are listed in
PLAN.md under "Do this first".
